# State Space Implementation in Java

I wrote this in order to learn the basics of how state space control works. 
I've switched most of my development in this area to Python, but will continue to update if needed.

## Features

 - State Space Controller
 - Simulation Support
 - Graphing support (Real-time graphing too, but it's a bit glitchy)
 
## WIP
 - State Space Observer
 - A modular way of specifying which parts of the error are actually calculated
 - More models of real-world systems
